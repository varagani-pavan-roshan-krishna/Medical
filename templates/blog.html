        <h2 class="text-center">Symptom-Based Disease Diagnosis Web App</h2>
        <p class="text-center text-muted">Developed by Varagani Pavan Roshan</p>
        <p>As a Full Stack Developer and AI Enthusiast, I am passionate about building innovative solutions that make a difference. This project aims to bridge the gap between healthcare and technology by providing a machine-learning-powered web app for disease diagnosis.</p>

        <h3>The Problem</h3>
        <p>Many individuals experience symptoms but lack immediate access to medical consultations. Our solution empowers users with preliminary insights into their health concerns.</p>

        <h3>The Solution</h3>
        <p>Using Flask for the backend and a Decision Tree Classifier model, this web app provides instant disease predictions based on user-input symptoms.</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Symptom Input:</strong> Users enter their symptoms in a simple, user-friendly interface.</li>
            <li><strong>Machine Learning Model:</strong> A Decision Tree Classifier trained on a comprehensive dataset predicts potential diseases.</li>
            <li><strong>Prediction:</strong> The model provides instant results, helping users understand possible health concerns.</li>
            <li><strong>Additional Information:</strong> The app offers insights on the predicted disease, including symptoms, precautions, medications, and lifestyle tips.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Key Features</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>User-Friendly Interface:</strong> A sleek and intuitive design ensures seamless navigation.</li>
            <li><strong>Accurate Predictions:</strong> Leveraging AI and machine learning, the app delivers reliable disease predictions.</li>
            <li><strong>Comprehensive Health Insights:</strong> Users gain access to relevant health information to make informed decisions.</li>
            <li><strong>Educational Content:</strong> The platform includes health-related blog posts to enhance awareness.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>My goal is to make healthcare more accessible by integrating AI with medical knowledge. This project serves as a stepping stone toward that vision, enabling users to gain quick insights into potential health conditions.</p>
